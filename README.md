# Airbnb EDA Project
This is the Capstone project which is a part of my Data Science course at AlmaBetter. 

## Dataset
The Airbnb NYC dataset provides a comprehensive collection of data related to Airbnb listings in New York City. It encompasses a wide range of information, including listing details, host information, pricing, availability, and reviews. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for analyzing the dynamics of the Airbnb market in NYC, understanding rental trends, and gaining insights into the preferences and behaviors of hosts and guests. Researchers and analysts can leverage this dataset to explore patterns, make data-driven decisions, and uncover valuable insights in the realm of short-term rentals in one of the most vibrant cities in the world.

## Summary of this Project*-

Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with people who are looking for accommodations in that locale. It currently covers more than 100,000 cities and 220 countries worldwide.
For hosts, it's a way to earn money while protecting their property from potential damage. However, for guests, it's a risky venture that they should avoid.

For this project we are analyzing Airbnbâ€™s New York City(NYC) data of 2019. NYC is not only the most famous city in the world but also top global destination for visitors drawn to its museums, entertainment, restaurants and commerce. According to the Office of New York State Comptroller, NYC hosted 66.6 million visitors in 2019.

The analysis of the extensive Airbnb NYC dataset plays a pivotal role in the operations of the company. Our primary goal is to uncover the key factors that impact property listings on the platform. To achieve this, we employ fundamental exploratory data analysis techniques to thoroughly investigate and visualize the dataset. By examining various aspects such as location, price range, room type, and listing details, we gain valuable insights into the distribution of Airbnb listings. Through a comprehensive analysis from multiple perspectives, we have discovered intriguing patterns and trends. These findings empower the marketing, finance, and technical teams at Airbnb to make informed decisions supported by data-driven strategies.
